1. constructor invocation in inheritance hierarchy

2. difference between no arg constructor and default constructor

3. if my base class method is static 
can i override that method in sub class

4. emp , manager , admin
emp is a base class
manager and admin are sub classes

when ever we create a object of emp or manager or admin or all together say 2 obj of each class

finally only one output should be printed and the output should say

o/p --> no of obj created is 6 or no of emp are 6

Hint : it shud not print for every obj
       it uses super()
       prog of constructor invoc in inheritance


class A {}, whats the base class for it?

java.lang.Object

String s="hello";

sysout(s instanceof String);
sysout(s instanceof Object);

if it prints true the u check

Object b=s; //possible and this is upcasting

Integer i=90;

sysout(i instanceof Integer);
sysout(i instanceof Object);

if it prints true the u check

Object b=i; //possible and this is upcasting

class  Empl - obj of Empl is emp

class Admin extends Empl - obj of admin ad

	sysout(ad instanceof Admin)
	sysout(ad instanceof Empl)
	sysout(ad instanceof Object)

a. tv, Dvd, Laptop if these are subclasses what can be their logical correct base class name
b. implement dyn poly for the same scenario
